What it is
----------

* dragonplayer: Video Player is a very simple Phonon-based media player.
* kmix: the audio mixer as a standalone program and Kicker applet
* kscd: A CD player with an interface to the internet CDDB database

The following are libraries and plugins that are building the core
infrastructure of above applications:

* strigi-analyzer: provide meta information about sound files
* libkcddb: a library for retrieving and sending cddb information

Common Mistakes
---------------

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.trolltech.com
to get a copy of latest Qt 4.3.x version.

Debugging
---------
You can use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull with the cmake command script, if you
want to have debug code in your KDE apps and libs. We recommend to do this,
since this is alpha software and this makes debugging things a whole lot
easier.


More Info
---------

Have a look at the individual subdirectories, if you want to know, what
versions of apps are included.

Please direct any bug reports to our bug list by visiting
http://bugs.kde.org.

General KDE discussions should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).
